### Example walkthrough

The quick start example blinks the LED on your board on and off. The main thread also takes a snapshot of the device's runtime statistics and displays them over a serial connection to your PC.

#### Viewing the output

To view the serial output use any terminal client, such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) or [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/).

The default baud rate, or speed, for this application is set to `9600`. You can modify it in the `mbed_app.json` file. To configure your terminal client to this baud rate, change the speed option when selecting the port.

The output transmits the following block at the blinking LED frequency (actual values may vary depending on your target, build profile and toolchain):

#### Understanding the output

##### System information

**Mbed OS version:** Tip of master is represented by 999999. If you are using a tagged release of Mbed OS, the version will be configured by the OS. For custom releases, you can modify the version manually in `platform/mbed_version.h`.
