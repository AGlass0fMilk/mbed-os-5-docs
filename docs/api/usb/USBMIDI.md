You can use the USBMIDI interface to send and receive MIDI messages over USB using the standard USB-MIDI protocol.

Examples of tasks you can perform using this library include sending MIDI messages to a computer (such as to record in a sequencer, or trigger a software synthesiser) and receiving messages from a computer (such as actuating things based on MIDI events).
