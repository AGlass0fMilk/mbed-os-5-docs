## MBRBlockDevice

<span class="images">![](https://os.mbed.com/docs/development/mbed-os-api-doxy/class_m_b_r_block_device.png)<span>MBRBlockDevice class hierarchy</span></span>

The MBRBlockDevice class provides a way to manage a Master Boot Record (MBR) on a storage device, which allows you to partition the device. Without the MBR, you can still format a storage device with a file system, but including the MBR will allow for future partition modifications.

MBRBlockDevices have the following configurable parameters in the constructor:

  - _bd_ - Block device to back the MBRBlockDevice
  - _part_ - Partition to use, 1-4

You can view more information about the configurable settings and functions in the class reference. To configure this class, please see our [BlockDevice configuration documentation](../reference/configuration-storage.html#blockdevice-default-configuration).

### MBRBlockDevice example

Partition a heap backed block device into two partitions. This example also uses the [HeapBlockDevice](heapblockdevice.html).

Partition an SD card, and format the new partition with a FAT filesystem. A PC will now be able to recognize the SD card.
