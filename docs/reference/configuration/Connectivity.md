<h1 id="configuration-connectivity">Connectivity</h1>

This page describes build-time configurable parameters for connectivity in Mbed OS. There are a few categories of configurable connectivity parameters, so we have structured this page between different connectivity methods:

- [LwIP configuration](#lwip-configuration).
- [LwIP memory optimization](#lwip-memory-optimization).
- [LwIP Protocol support](#lwip-protocol-support).
- [Cellular configuration](#cellular-configuration).
- [Selecting the default network interface](#selecting-the-default-network-interface).

<span class="notes">**Note:** You can find settings for Mesh networking under [6LoWPAN and Thread Mesh](configuration-mesh.html).</span>

The following is the complete list of connectivity configuration parameters, as generated by `mbed compile --config -v`. Please see [the configuration system documentation](configuration.html) for details on how you may use or override these settings.

## Selecting the default network interface

Applications can use the default network interface without directly specifying its type. This requires settings from `mbed_app.json` to work.

Example application code can be as simple as:

```
    NetworkInterface *net = NetworkInterface::get_default_instance();
    if (!net) {
        // There is no default...
    }
    net->connet();
```

Boards that provide only Ethernet connectivity do not require any configuration. The default settings are sufficient. Boards that provide other connectivity options require selecting the default interface type and providing settings for it.

Select the default interface type by using one of the following `target.network-default-interface-type` parameters:

| `target.network-default-interface-type` | Required configuration |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `ETHERNET` | nothing |
| `WIFI`     | `nsapi.default-wifi-security`, `nsapi.default-wifi-ssid` and `nsapi.default-wifi-password` |
| `CELLULAR` | `nsapi.default-cellular-apn`, `nsapi.default-cellular-username` and `nsapi.default-cellular-password` |
| `MESH`     | `nsapi.default-mesh-type` |

```
