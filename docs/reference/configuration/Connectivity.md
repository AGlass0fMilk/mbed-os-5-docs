You can configure various parameters using either C++ APIs or the Arm Mbed configuration system. The following is the complete list of connectivity configuration parameters, as generated by `mbed compile --config -v`. Please see [the configuration system documentation](/docs/5.8/reference/configuration.html) for details on how you may use or override these settings.

To change any of these parameters, edit the `mbed_app.json` file in the root of your application. Prefix the parameter name, for example, `lora.my-parameter: value`.

```json
"target_overrides": {
    "*": {
        "lora.device-address":  "0x12345678",
        "lora.over-the-air-activation": true,
        "lora.duty-cycle-on": true
    }
}
```
