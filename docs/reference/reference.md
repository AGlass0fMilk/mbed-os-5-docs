# Mbed OS reference book

Arm Mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand. This section covers technical API details. To get started on Mbed OS, see our [getting started guide](/docs/v5.9/tutorials/mbed-os-quick-start.html).

Your application code is written in C++. Your code uses the application programming interfaces (APIs) that Mbed OS provides. These APIs allow your code to work on different microcontrollers in a uniform way. This reduces a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers.

This is the basic architecture of an Mbed board:
