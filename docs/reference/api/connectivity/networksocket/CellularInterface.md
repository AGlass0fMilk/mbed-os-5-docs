The CellularBase provides a C++ API for connecting to the internet over a Cellular device.

Arm Mbed OS provides a [reference implementation of CellularBase](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/master/features/netsocket/cellular/generic_modem_driver), which has more information.

### Usage

To bring up the network interface:

1. Instantiate an implementation of the CellularBase class.
1. Call the `connect(pincode, apn)` function with a PIN code for your SIM card and an APN for your network.
1. Once connected, you can use Mbed OS [network sockets](/docs/v5.7/reference/network-socket.html) as usual.

### Cellular example: connection establishment
